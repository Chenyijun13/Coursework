# Coursework
I don't know what happened, but starting from 19 January 2021 at 1:03pm, I was unable to upload updates to my github. i just wanted to go and add my name and general description to each of my files because it was not possible to update Github, which in turn caused the version in my github to be missing my name and description compared to the version in Blackboard, even though the main parts of the code remain unchanged..
